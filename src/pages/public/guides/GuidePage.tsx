    summary: "PTL (Part Truck Load) is ideal for shipments under 3 tonnes, offering 30-40% savings by sharing truck space. FTL (Full Truck Load) is best for shipments over 7 tonnes needing exclusive vehicle use. LoadSaathi offers both options on all East India corridors.",

      "One of the most common questions from new shippers is whether to book PTL or FTL for their freight. The answer depends on your shipment size, budget, timeline, and the specific route you're shipping on.",
      "PTL (Part Truck Load) is a shared freight model where your goods share truck space with other shipments heading in the same direction. It's ideal for shipments under 3 tonnes and typically costs 30-40% less than booking an entire truck. The tradeoff is slightly longer transit times due to multiple pickups and deliveries.",
      "FTL (Full Truck Load) gives you exclusive use of an entire vehicle. Your goods go directly from origin to destination without intermediate stops. FTL is best for shipments over 7 tonnes, time-sensitive cargo, high-value goods requiring dedicated security, and when you need the fastest possible transit time.",
      "LoadSaathi offers both PTL and FTL options on all major East India corridors. When you post your shipment, our AI automatically recommends the most cost-effective option based on your weight, volume, and delivery requirements.",
      "Key decision factors: PTL for cost savings and flexibility, FTL for speed and exclusivity. Most MSMEs in East India find PTL to be the optimal choice for regular shipments, while FTL is reserved for urgent or high-value cargo.",

      "The Rourkela–Ranchi corridor (180 km) is one of the busiest, with PTL rates averaging ₹1,800-2,500 per tonne. Full truckload rates range from ₹9,000-12,000 for a 7-ton truck to ₹22,000-28,000 for a 25-ton trailer.",
      "For the Rourkela–Bhubaneswar route (340 km), expect PTL rates of ₹2,200-3,000 per tonne. The Rourkela–Kolkata corridor (430 km) commands ₹2,500-3,500 per tonne for PTL shipments.",
      "Several factors influence pricing: fuel costs, toll charges, seasonal demand during festivals, truck availability in both cities, and the type of cargo being shipped. Steel products from Rourkela's mills often command slightly higher rates.",
